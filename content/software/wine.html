  I keep forgetting how to use this once in a while, but pretty much find your windows software, go to winehq and check the compatibility of the version you just downloaded, and see if people are saying it runs ok or not, if not find a version that works and download that. Then go to the directory with the exe and open a terminal and run <code>wine your_program.exe</code>
