<p><strong>Changing container without re-encoding content could not be simpler:</strong></p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mkv -codec copy output.mp4</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>It auto-detects a Matroska to MP4 container conversion based on input/output filenames. Feel free to try other formats.</li>

  <li><code>-codec copy</code> stream copies, or "re-muxes", the streams from the input to the output without re-encoding. Think of it like a copy and paste between containers.</li>

  <li>Default stream selection behavior is to select only one stream per stream type. For example, if your input has two video streams and one audio stream then only the video stream with the largest frame size will be selected. Add <code>-map 0</code> if you want to select all streams from the input.</li>

  <li>Some containers may not support some formats. So check if your chosen container format, be it mkv, mp4 or even avi has support for all the content in your files (video, audio, subtitles, data, etc). For example, mp4 does not support SubRip subtitles (.srt files).</li>
</ul>
