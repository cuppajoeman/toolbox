So pretty much I only have 8gb of ram so I don't use a daw, I download surge-xt or any external synth, then I use anchor-systems c-keyboard as a midi input device, then I download pulsemeeter and I create a virtual output and input and a hardware output called headpohnes, and then I route my synth to the virtual input and make it forward to the virtual output and headphones, then install audacity, then in audacity I got to settings and use jack in the settings and select my output and recording device, then I can solo record the synth while still hearing the other things.
