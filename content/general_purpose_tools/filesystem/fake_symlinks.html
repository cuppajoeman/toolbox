  Sometimes you want something like a symlink but isn't acutally a symlink so you can maintain cross platform support, I created this program which allows us to do this.
</p>

<div class="code-file" data-file-name="flinx.py"></div>

<p>
  To operate this, whenever you want to do <code>ln -s /a/b/c/d/e.txt /h/i/j/k/l.txt</code>, instead you create a <code>/h/i/j/k/.flinks</code> file with the contents <code>/a/b/c/d/e.txt -> l.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
  A real example of a <code>.flinx</code> file can look like this:
</p>

<code>.flinks</code>
<pre>
  <code>
sphere_orbiter -> ../single_player/src/system_logic/sphere_orbiter
random_vector -> ../single_player/src/system_logic/random_vector

sphere_orbiter -> ../server/src/system_logic/sphere_orbiter
random_vector -> ../server/src/system_logic/random_vector

...
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  In the above we demonstrated that you can use directories as well as files. Note that the paths are relative to the directory containing the <code>.flinx</code> file and the format is SOURCE -> DEST. 
</p>

<p>
  The previous <code>.flinx</code> file was pushing out the local sphere_orbiter and random_vector directories out to where they should be. On the other hand we can have more of a pulling file like this: 
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
../../src/utility/logger/logger/ -> logger
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Where we're grabbing what we need and bringing it into the currect directory.
