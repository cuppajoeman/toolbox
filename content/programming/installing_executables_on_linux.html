<p>If you've made a terminal program on Linux, then sometimes you want to use that program from any directory on the system. The concept of making this happen is usually called <strong>"installing a program."</strong></p>

<p>Once you build your executable, you can move it to a directory that's in your system's <code>PATH</code>. A common location for user-installed programs is /usr/local/bin, here is one way we can move it there:</p>

<pre><code>sudo cp -i fibber /usr/local/bin/</code></pre>

<p>
  The purpose of the -i flag here (which is interactive mode) is that it will warn you if you're going to overwrite a file. This is important because if its you're first time installing the program and you accidentally try to overwrite something like ls, it will warn you. On the other-hand if you're just updating the program, then you should be fine to overwrite, but be careful.
</p>

<p>To uninstall the program, we run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rm /usr/local/bin/fibber</code></pre>

<p>This simply removes the executable from the system-wide binary directory, effectively uninstalling the program.</p>
