  I installed endeavor os with a KDE desktop evnrionment and then downloaded <code>neovim</code> after launching there was no clipboard support after running <code>:checkhealth</code>. I downloaded <code>xclip</code> and it didn't work, then I downloaded <code>xsel</code> and it still didn't work, only after thinking a while I realized that my KDE plasma uses wayland and not x11, and programs tat start with x usually only work with x11, so instead I installed <code>wl-clipboard</code> and it all worked.
