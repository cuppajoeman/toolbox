  When you're writing code inside of the body of a fixed frequency loop, then just because it exists in the body doesn't mean it will be run at a fixed frequency. Formally here's the truth.
</p>

<p>
  Suppose you have a loop which iterates at a fixed rate, and you have n functions f1, ..., fn and the loop body is of this form
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
while (...) {
    f1(...)
    f2(...)
    ...
    fn(...)
}
  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  Then function fi will only run at a fixed rate if the functions f1, ..., fi-1 have constant runtime.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
  Since the outer loop runs at a fixed frequency F hz and period P = 1 / F. If the times that it iterates is at are the times w1, w2, w3, ... .So in general we know that wi+1 - wi = P.
</p>
<p>
  Since each function f1, ..., fi-1 have constant runtime, then on each iteration each function will take duration t1, ..., ti-1 respectively, therefore function fi will be run at times w1 + (t1 + ... + ti-1), w2 + (t1 + ... + ti-1), w3 + (t1 + ... + ti-1), ... Therefore the difference between consecutive runs of the function fi is exactly (wi+1 - wi) = P, so fi is run at the constant frequency F.
</p>

  Another way of seeing it, is that if one of f1, ..., fi-1 had a dynamic runtime. What I mean when I say constant vs dynamic runtime is that the duration of the function differs from iteration to iteration. An example of such a function is a sorting function which will run faster on inputs which are already pretty much sorted and take longer on those which are not. 
</p>
<p>
  Suppose function fj has dynamic runtime (and that the rest had constant runtime) and that on iteration k, it took time tk and on iteration k+1 it took time t_(k+1) to execute, and lets suppose that t_(k+1) = t_k + a where a > 0. So on iteration k of the while loop function fi starts executing at wk + (t1 + ... + tk + ... + ti-1) and on iteration k+1 fi will start executing at wk + (t1 + ... + tk + a + ... + ti-1) the difference of these two times is exactly P + a, so the function fi is no longer being run at a constant rate.
