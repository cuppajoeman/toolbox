<p>
    Managing a vimrc doesn't have to be hard, I recommend using a modular setup like this:
</p>

<div class="code-file" data-file-name=".vimrc"></div>

<p>
    I also don't usually keep my vimrc file in the root directory, and so I usually do a link like this
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        ln -s /Users/cjm/projects/toolbox/content/programming/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
    </code>
</pre>
