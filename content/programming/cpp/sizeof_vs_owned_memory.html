<p>
    In C++, <code>sizeof(T)</code> only gives the size of the type T itself, including the size of its members and pointers, but it does not account for dynamically allocated memory or resources managed outside the object (such as heap-allocated memory pointed to by pointers). Therefore if you want to know how much memory is being used up by an object you cannot rely on <code>sizeof</code>
