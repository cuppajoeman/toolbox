<p>
  In C++, class member variables are initialized in the order they are declared in the class, 
  not in the order they appear in the constructor's initializer list. This can lead to subtle bugs, 
  especially when one member depends on another during construction.
</p>

<h2>Key Rule</h2>
<p>
  Regardless of the order used in the constructor's initializer list, the compiler initializes 
  the members in the order they are declared in the class.
</p>

<h2>Example: Incorrect Assumption</h2>
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

class Example {
  std::string first;
  std::string second;

public:
  Example()
      : second("Derived from: " + first), first("Initialized First") {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; "first: " &lt;&lt; first &lt;&lt; "\n";
      std::cout &lt;&lt; "second: " &lt;&lt; second &lt;&lt; "\n";
  }
};

int main() {
  Example ex;
  return 0;
</pre>

<p>
  <strong>Output:</strong><br>
  first: Initialized First<br>
  second: Derived from: 
</p>

<p>
  Even though <code>first</code> is listed after <code>second</code> in the initializer list, it is still initialized 
  before <code>second</code> because it appears first in the class definition. As a result, 
  <code>second</code> uses the default (empty) value of <code>first</code> when constructing its own value.
</p>

<h2>Corrected Version</h2>
<pre>
class Example {
  std::string second;
  std::string first;

public:
  Example()
      : second("Derived from: " + first), first("Initialized First") {}
};
</pre>

<p>
  In this corrected version, <code>first</code> is declared after <code>second</code> in the class, 
  so it is initialized after <code>second</code> â€” still wrong!
  To truly fix the issue, you must either:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reorder the declarations to place <code>first</code> before <code>second</code>, and</li>
  <li>Ensure the constructor uses initializer list in the same logical order for clarity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>
  Always remember: C++ initializes class members in the order of declaration, not the initializer list order.
  This means the safest approach is to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Declare members in dependency order</li>
  <li>Match the constructor initializer list order with the declaration order</li>
</ul>
