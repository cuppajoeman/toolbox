  Suppose you have the following code, which has a clear memory leak, and you build it with adress sanitizer, if you hit ctrl-c you won't get any output from it, we'll explore why and how to fix this situation.
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    malloc(100);
    while (true) {
    }
}

  </code>
</pre>

<p>
  The reason you don't see AddressSanitizer (ASan) reports when you terminate the program with Ctrl+C is that ASan reports memory leaks only when the program exits normally. When you send a SIGINT (Ctrl+C), the program terminates abruptly, and ASan doesn't get a chance to run its leak detection. We can fix this by handling the interrupt signal with a signal handler to exit gracefully, thus seeing the asan results:
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
#include <iostream>
#include <csignal>
#include <cstdlib>

void handle_signal(int) {
    std::exit(1);  // Clean exit triggers ASan
}

int main() {
    malloc(100);  // Memory leak
    std::signal(SIGINT, handle_signal);  // Handle Ctrl+C
    while (true) {}  // Infinite loop
}

  </code>
</pre>
