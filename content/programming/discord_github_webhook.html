<p>
  Sometimes I want a channel to show github events on discord. go to discord go to the server you own and then go to apps>integrations>webhooks>create webhook>copy webhook URL.
  Then go to the repo/organization and then add a webhook, and paste that as the payload url and then add <code>/github</code> at the end, content type>json, send me everything (your choice).
