<h1>getting a scrim</h1>

<p>Step one, on the day or the day before get into the RGL discord server, and go to the looking for sixes scrim channel. If there are an LFS, message them in the DM and ask if it's still available, next you should verify their team and make sure it will be a fair fight, the main thing is to ask them for a link to their RGL team page, once you get that you can check to see if they're in the same division as you, if they are and it looks like a good match then you can say "yeah, let's scrim" or something like that</p>

<p>
  Next you'll want to choose maps for the scrim, scrims consist of two matches played on potentially two different maps, you request one map and the other team picks the other, you can say "We pick MAPNAME".
</p>

<h1>getting players</h1>

<p>
  Personally I find scrims before I confirm my players this it's not a guarentee that all your players will respond even if they can play and if you want until they do it might not be possible to find a scrim anymore. In my experience it's best to find a scrim at least 2 hours before the scrim time or else it gets a lot harder to find a scrim, that's why I find the scrim first, it's easier to find spare players then to find a new scrim.
</p>
  
<p>
  Next we have to make sure we have enough players. To do this make a post in the roll call channel with the time of the game, and make sure you get a response back from all the players you need. If you don't then ping them personally. If they still don't answer, then you can check your subs and tell them early only that they might have to play tonight. If they say ok, great. If they can't then you can check any other subs, and then you can check for ringers.
</p>

<p>
  To find a ringer you go into the looking for player 6s channel and make a post like "LFR pocket scout 830", you will get responces in your DMs, then send them an invite link to join the discord server (I invite them to the #everyone channel). Additionally here is the order in which it is hardest to find ringers.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>demoman</li>
  <li>medic</li>
  <li>flank scout</li>
  <li>pocket scout</li>
  <li>pocket soldier</li>
  <li>roamer soldier</li>
</ol>

<p>
  So if you're looking for a demo/med ringer start looking early and get it confirmed early, whereas soldiers are easy to find.
</p>

<p>Now that you've confirmed all your players can play, you need a server, see my article on that for more information.</p>

<p>In the most common scenario you've scheduled 2 scrims at 8:30 and 9:30. Now you're in the server, if the map is wrong you should change the map (you need rcon and changelevel commands, refer to my page on it). When the first match of the first match of the first scrim finishes you might need to change the map level, to do that refer to my page on dealing with servers.</p>

<p>
  When the time approaches 930 you'll want to see what the other team is saying, the other team might want to leave early and in that case you should invoke the winlimit commands specified on the other page to end the game early, otherwise you can play it out if they don't care. 
</p>

<h1>getting baited and unexpected situations</h1>

<p>
  If someone has a situation that warrants a game pause, something important that will take less than 5 minutes to deal with, then you can pause the game. Otherwise if it's longer than that you should probably just find a replacement. If they're gone for more than 5 minutes start immedialy putting a "LFR RN classname" in the RGL channel for looking for player incase they don't come back. The most common cause of this is like a power outage or a real life problem that needs to be handled.
</p>

<p>
  If the team you set a scrim up with baits you and decides that they can't scrim you, then you need to immediately make a "LFR scrim RN, got baited" post in the looking for game channel in the RGL, hopefully you can find another one, but maybe you can't, if you can't find another scrim by 8:45 or 9:45 assume there will be no scrim and let people know.
</p>

<p>
  If the enemy team has told you they want to scrim, but doesn't arrive by 8:50 or 9:50, you can assume they are baiting you. 
</p>

<p>
  If you get baited you can turn the server into a MGE server and run 2v2 MGE or something like that.
