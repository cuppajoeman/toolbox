<p>Step one, on the day or the day before get into the RGL discord server, and go to the looking for sixes scrim channel. If there are an LFS, message them in the DM and ask if it's still available. If it is, then you can say "I pick MAPNAME" because scrims will consist of two games.</p>

<p>Next we have to make sure we have enough players (and potentially do this first, but I always assume I can find enough ringers to make a game happen). To do this make a post in the roll call channel with the time of the game, and make sure you get a response back from all the players you need. If you don't then ping them personally. If they still don't answer, then you can check your subs and tell them early only that they might have to play tonight. If they say ok, great. If they can't then you can check any other subs, and then you can check for ringers (note that ringers are only allowed in scrims, if it is a match you have no option other than using your subs, and if you don't have any you have to forfeit the game).</p>

<p>Now that you've confirmed all your players can play, you need a server. Go to na.serveme.tf and make a reservation. I recommend starting the reservation 30 mins before you play and 30 minutes post game buffer time. You can send the connect info to the scrim team as early as you want.</p>

<p>In the most common scenario you've scheduled 2 scrims at 8:30 and 9:30. Now you're in the server, if the map is wrong you should change the map (you need rcon and changelevel commands, refer to my page on it). When the first match of the first scrim finishes you need to change the map level, to do that refer to my page on dealing with servers. While you're in your second match of the first scrim you'll want to keep your eye on who's connecting to the server. If you start to see more than 3 people join it probably means that it's close to 9:30 so you should keep your eye on the time. At 9:30 you need to end the scrim no matter what is happening (I guess if you're about to cap last then you can do that first lol). To do this you need to set mp_winlimit to 1 (refer to other page). When the other team starts leaving you can change maps if required and make sure to set the winlimit back to 5.</p>

<p>If someone has a situation that warrants a game pause, something important that will take less than 5 minutes to deal with, then you can pause the game. Otherwise if it's longer than that you should probably just find a replacement. This is where having subs comes in handy, so the moment you know this information you should look for a sub or look for a ringer, and bring them in and unpause the game.</p>
