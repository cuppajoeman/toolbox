  Here are some ideas that you can do on mid.
</p>

<h3>double bomb fade</h3>

<h3>cross point spam</h3>

<p>
  Good spots to be on mid are places where you won't take damage but you can shoot others, from there if you get damage you can call it out, if you can't get any damage, then you can still bomb from these locations.

  With this angle you can get a good splash view onto other players, and works well when your team is rotating right on mid, it also gives you a two rocket bomb onto them as they rotate.

If you realize that your team is dying then you should leave, unless your med died, then you should probably try and feed for their med.
