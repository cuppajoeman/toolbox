  <h1>How to Play Snakewater in 6v6 Team Fortress 2</h1>

  <p>Snakewater is a classic 5CP map that plays tightly around choke points, high ground, and narrow doorways. Because of this, pushing without player or Uber advantage is often risky and can easily backfire. This guide will break down how to play each point—Mid, Second, and Last—under even Ubers, Uber disadvantage, and Uber advantage scenarios.</p>

  <h2>Mid Point</h2>
  <p>Snakewater midfights revolve heavily around tempo and the decision to bomb or not bomb your Soldiers.</p>

  <h3>Even Ubers</h3>
  <p>There are two main styles of mid on Snakewater:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bomb Mid:</strong> Both Soldiers bomb in early to pressure the enemy combo, ideally picking off key targets or forcing early positioning errors. Your combo follows up to capitalize on the disruption. This style plays aggressively and is high risk, high reward.</li>
    <li><strong>Passive Mid:</strong> Soldiers stay with the combo or take defensive high ground, focusing on protecting the Medic and countering enemy bombs. You can still bomb one Soldier situationally to catch overextenders. This style is more controlled and allows for better survivability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Uber Disadvantage</h3>
  <p>Mid is typically lost before Uber disadvantage becomes relevant, but in a repush scenario, you must rely on off-classes or flanks to create chaos. Consider Sniper or Spy to open a window for a clean re-entry, or hold a forward position to force the enemy Uber before they get deep into your side.</p>

  <h3>Uber Advantage</h3>
  <p>If you're repushing with Uber advantage, use it decisively through choke or dropdown. Send one Soldier ahead to scout and the other to chase, while your combo clears high ground and pushes the enemy back into second. Post-Uber cleanup is key to retaking control.</p>

  <h2>Second Point</h2>
  <p>Second is one of the hardest points to push on Snakewater due to tight chokes and a strong defender’s high ground. Coordinated entries and clean Ubers are necessary.</p>

  <h3>Even Ubers</h3>
  <p>Pushing even into Second is dangerous. Defenders can control the dropdown, the stairs, and kitchen, making it hard to gain ground. You’ll often need to create a player advantage or force them out with a Sniper before pushing. Otherwise, hold and wait for a mistake or pick.</p>

  <h3>Uber Disadvantage</h3>
  <p>On disad, play to delay and force the enemy early. Hold close at choke or dropdown to bait the enemy Uber. Your goal is to survive the Uber and punish any overextensions. Keep Scouts on the flanks to threaten backcaps if the enemy commits too deep.</p>

  <h3>Uber Advantage</h3>
  <p>Push quickly before the enemy has time to get off-classes up. Choose an entrance (typically choke or dropdown) and clear the high ground. Your goal should be to cleanly clear the point, secure post-Uber frags, and deny escape routes. If you stall too long, defenders will stabilize and get spawns.</p>

  <h2>Last Point</h2>
  <p>Last is extremely defender-sided. Without a big advantage or a pick, pushes will often fail due to close spawns and strong sightlines.</p>

  <h3>Even Ubers</h3>
  <p>Don’t push even unless you have a pick or a very strong off-class setup (e.g., a Sniper in Shutter). The defender has a natural advantage with spawn proximity and better ground. Wait for a mistake, or try to bait them into a fight outside of Last where they are more exposed.</p>

  <h3>Uber Disadvantage</h3>
  <p>Hold close enough to force but far enough back to survive. Use off-classes like Pyro or Engineer to stall time. Your team should be ready to collapse on the enemy post-Uber or scout for backcap opportunities if the enemy fails to cleanly capture.</p>

  <h3>Uber Advantage</h3>
  <p>With Uber ad, you must commit fast and hard. Choose a door (usually Left or Shutter), pop through, and clear the close hold. A Soldier should take high ground or clear the top right ledge while Scouts cap. Your combo needs
