  I was building a project in various configurations, such as with adress sanitizer and without it, but the underlying architecture didn't change, since I had a build where I had asan turned on and off, there was a conflict in the preset names generated by conan, in order to fix this I read into the documentation, where on page 517+ of  <a href="https://docs.conan.io/2.6/conan.pdf">this file</a> it talked about how the preset name was generated and I learned that putting a line like this into my profile will modify the name of the preset causing the duplicated names to go away.
